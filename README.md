A demo that shows how to use Pusher Chatkit and React in building a native desktop chat app. The native feature is powered by Electron.

## Setup

- Clone the repository
- Install all dependencies with `npm install`. This will take longer than normal because of the Electron scripts
- Start the auth server with `npm run server`
- In another terminal window, start the React app with `npm start`. This will open the React app in a browser. Ignore the browser and move to the next step.
- Start the desktop app with `npm run electron`
